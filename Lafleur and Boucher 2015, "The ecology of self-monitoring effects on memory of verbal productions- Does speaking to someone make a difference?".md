[Lafleur and Boucher 2015, "The ecology of self-monitoring effects on memory of verbal productions: Does speaking to someone make a difference?"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810015001518):

> **Highlights**
> 
> * Tasks of verbal self-monitoring reveal the effects of sensory feedback on memory of spoken words.
> * We show that sensory feedback has differential effects on memory of spoken words but not non-words.
> * Talking to someone enhances the effect of sensory feedback on recall of produced words.
> * Central Monitoring Theory (CMT) accounts for the effects of feedback on memory of spoken non-words.
> * CMT does not account for enhancing effects of speaker–listener gaze on memory of spoken forms.

> **Abstract**
> 
> Experiments involving verbal self-monitoring show that memory for spoken words varies with types of sensory feedback: memory is better when words are spoken aloud than when they are lip-synched or covertly produced. Such effects can be explained by the Central Monitoring Theory (CMT) via a process that matches a forward model reflecting expected sensory effects of practiced forms and sensory information during speech. But CMT oversees factors of shared attention as achieved by speaker–listener gaze, and implies that sensory feedback may not affect the learning of unpracticed forms (non-words). These aspects of CMT were examined in two experiments of self-monitoring focusing on oro-sensory feedback. In Experiment 1 we show that varying feedback creates differential effects on memory for spoken words and that speaker–listener gaze alters these effects. Using non-words, Experiment 2 shows the absence of differential feedback effects. The results confirm CMT but suggest the need to refine the theory in terms of processes that mediate attention.
