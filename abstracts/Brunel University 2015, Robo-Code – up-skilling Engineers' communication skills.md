[Brunel University 2015, "Robo-Code – up-skilling Engineers’ communication skills, enabling them to stimulate young people through engagement with Engineering"](http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/ingenious-awards-round-9-2015#8):

> Royal Academy of Engineering, 2015 [Ingenious](http://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/ingenious-grant) awardee. Amount awarded £29,625.

> **Description**
> 
> Robo-Code builds on Brunel University London’s well-established STEM outreach activities  to  produce  a  replicable,  scalable,  cost-effective  model.  This  pilot  will include  robotics  programmingand  will  be  delivered  in  schools  by  postgraduate engineering  students  and  professional  engineers.  Offering  an  almost  indefinite legacy  period  through  a  “train  the  trainer”  model,  it  addresses  problems associated with many children being disenchanted with science early on in their school careers.
>
> Ingenious funding will be used to train and equip a cohort of 40 HEFCE-funded  Women  in  Engineering  MSc  scholarship  holders  with  creative public engagement and communication skills as well as specialist equipment and tools to be used in engagement sessions. The initial cohort will engage with the public (in this case school pupils) and also with fellow engineers, ensuring Robo-Code is “inherited” by other engineers (both genders) at various stages in their academic  learning,  on-going  professional  training  and  careers. 
>
> Robo-Code  is attractive to schools as it offers a fun, stimulating, engineering-wide and gender neutral way of introducing pupils aged 11-14 to programming and “engineering thinking” as required by the National  Curriculum.  Brunel  will  make  the  project available  via  its  multitude  of  communication  channels  to  interested  parties  and will disseminate learning outcomes widely.
