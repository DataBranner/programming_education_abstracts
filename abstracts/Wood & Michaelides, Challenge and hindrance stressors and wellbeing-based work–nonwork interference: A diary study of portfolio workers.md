[Wood & Michaelides, "Challenge and hindrance stressors and wellbeing-based workâ€“nonwork interference: A diary study of portfolio workers"](hum.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/10/14/0018726715580866.full.pdf):

This paper attempts to measure two different consequences on work-life balance and well-being of long hours doing contract-work: the effects of calmness and the effects of enthusiasm. The authors distinguish between "hindrance stressors" and "challenge stressors": 

> Hindrance stressors are work-related demands or circumstances that tend to constrain or interfere with an individual's achievements at work, and are not likely to be associated with potential gains for the individual. ... Almost by definition they are associated with negative outcomes, including negative effects on well-being, as they 'involve excessive or undesirable constraints' ... . These will create anxieties and psychological strain, and dampen enthusiasm and motivation, as 'the effort expended to cope with them is unlikely to be successful'.

> Challenge stressors are 'work-related demands or circumstances that . . . have associated potential gains for individuals' ... . The benefits derive from the opportunities they can provide for growth, learning and goal attainment. Taking advantage of such opportunities so that valued outcomes are achieved is a source of positive emotions. ... The beneficial effects of challenge stressors are reflected in worker outcomes such as continuance commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour, or less withdrawal behaviour, turnover and absence.

Based on a six-month diary study of contract workers, the authors conclude that both kinds of work stressor are correlated to interference in non-work life, but that a second pair of factors is also involved: anxiety-calmness and depression-enthusiasm. They find that

> For hindrance stressors the indirect effect is positive when mediated by calmness and negative for enthusiasm. In contrast, for challenge stressors the indirect effect is negative when mediated by calmness and positive when mediated by enthusiasm.

In other words, if I've understood correctly, "challenge" with calmness, and "hindrance" with enthusiasm, do not necessarily harm work-life balance.
