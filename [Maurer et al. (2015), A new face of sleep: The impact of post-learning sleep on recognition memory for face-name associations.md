[Maurer et al. (2015), "A new face of sleep: The impact of post-learning sleep on recognition memory for face-name associations"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742715001926):

> **Highlights**
> 
>  * We tested whether sleep influences the accuracy of remembering face-name associations.
>  * Presentation and recall were 12 h apart, one time with 8 h sleep and once without.
>  * More correct face-name pairs were recalled when there was a sleep opportunity.
>  * Sleep duration or sleep stage was not associated with improvement between conditions.
> 
> **Abstract**
> 
> Sleep has been demonstrated to improve consolidation of many types of new memories. However, few prior studies have examined how sleep impacts learning of face-name associations. The recognition of a new face along with the associated name is an important human cognitive skill. Here we investigated whether post-presentation sleep impacts recognition memory of new face-name associations in healthy adults.
> 
> Fourteen participants were tested twice. Each time, they were presented 20 photos of faces with a corresponding name. Twelve hours later, they were shown each face twice, once with the correct and once with an incorrect name, and asked if each face-name combination was correct and to rate their confidence. In one condition the 12-h interval between presentation and recall included an 8-h nighttime sleep opportunity (“Sleep”), while in the other condition they remained awake (“Wake”).
> 
> There were more correct and highly confident correct responses when the interval between presentation and recall included a sleep opportunity, although improvement between the “Wake” and “Sleep” conditions was not related to duration of sleep or any sleep stage.
> 
> These data suggest that a nighttime sleep opportunity improves the ability to correctly recognize face-name associations. Further studies investigating the mechanism of this improvement are important, as this finding has implications for individuals with sleep disturbances and/or memory impairments.
