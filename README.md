## Programming Education Abstracts

I ran foreign language classrooms for a couple of decades (rounded down). I abandoned academia in 2008 and cut my last salaried ties with it last year, after which I got my first programming job. A year on, I decided to try to move into the teaching of programming and computer science, and I've just found work in a for-profit school. It seems possible that this may end up being my actual second career, something I've been moving toward now for the proverbial seven years of indentureship. If so, I intend to try to attack this target properly. 

I am interested in what it takes for people to learn to code and to conduct the other activities needed to reason in this field; I'm interested as both a learner myself and someone who leads and shepherds others as they learn. So I've begun keeping records of the many abstracts of academic research I follow, when the topics pertain to issues touched on in learning to code.

I will try to keep the topics to pedagogical and social issues (broadly construed) that affect the learning of coding and related technical skills. These records are meant only to be pointers to full published articles.

Note that Sec. 107 of U.S. copyright law protects as "fair use" the re-posting of published abstracts and snippets of text for purpose of research.
