[Baylor University research-news summary for lay audience](http://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&story=161790):

> People who think they know it all — or at least, know a lot — may be on to something, according to a Baylor University study.
> 
> The finding was a surprise to researchers at Baylor and the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, who had theorized that “intellectual humility” — having an accurate or moderate view of one’s intelligence and being open to criticism and ideas — would correlate with academic grades.
> 
> Being full of oneself when it came to rating one’s intellectual arrogance — an exaggerated view of intellectual ability and knowledge — instead generally predicted academic achievement, especially on individual course work.

The actual research seems to have a much more technical focus: [Meagher et al. 2015, "Contrasting self-report and consensus ratings of intellectual humility and arrogance"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656615300039)

> **Highlights**
> 
> * This study assesses self- and relational judgments of intellectual humility (IH). [DPB: "relational" seems to mean through other people's evaluation, "round-robin judgments" by "unacquainted participants" and "following months of cooperative course work".]
> * No consensus for ratings of IH after 20 minute interactions in Study 1.
> * In Study 2, there was consensus for IH ratings following a semester of group work.
> * Self-reported IH was associated with self-enhancement, but relational IH was not.
> * Self-ratings of intellectual arrogance, not IH, positively associated with grades.
> 
> **Abstract**

> Despite a growing interest in intellectual humility (IH) and intellectual arrogance (IA), adequate measurement remains a challenging issue. This paper presents a pair of studies that compare two strategies: self-assessments and relational measures of group consensus. In Study 1, unacquainted participants provided round-robin judgments following a set of collaborative tasks. A social relations analysis revealed no consensus for either construct, making the relational measure untenable. However, a round-robin design following months of cooperative course work (Study 2) produced consensus for both constructs. Self-reported IH in both studies was positively associated with self-enhancement, despite the construct’s definitional association with accurate self-appraisals, whereas relational IH was not. These studies reveal key ways in which personal and relational assessments can differ.
